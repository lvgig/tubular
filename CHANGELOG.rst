Changelog
=========

This changelog follows the great advice from https://keepachangelog.com/.

Each section will have a title of the format ``X.Y.Z (YYYY-MM-DD)`` giving the version of the package and the date of release of that version. Unreleased changes i.e. those that have been merged into `main` (e.g. with a .dev suffix) but which are not yet in a new release (on pypi) are added to the changelog but with the title ``X.Y.Z (unreleased)``. Unreleased sections can be combined when they are released and the date of release added to the title.

Subsections for each version can be one of the following;

- ``Added`` for new features.
- ``Changed`` for changes in existing functionality.
- ``Deprecated`` for soon-to-be removed features.
- ``Removed`` for now removed features.
- ``Fixed`` for any bug fixes.
- ``Security`` in case of vulnerabilities.

Each individual change should have a link to the pull request after the description of the change.

1.4.1 (02/12/2024)
------------------

Changed
^^^^^^^

- Refactored BaseImputer to utilise narwhals `#314 <https://github.com/lvgig/tubular/issues/314>_`
- Converted test dfs to flexible pandas/polars setup
- Converted BaseNominalTransformer to utilise narwhals `#334 <https://github.com/lvgig/tubular/issues/334>_`

- Changed behaviour of NearestMeanResponseImputer so that if there are no nulls at fit, 
  it warns and has no effect at transform, as opposed to erroring. The error was problematic for e.g.
  lightweight test runs where nulls are less likely to be present.

1.4.0 (2024-10-15)

- Modified OneHotEncodingTransformer, made an instance of OneHotEncoder and assign it to attribut _encoder `#308 <https://github.com/lvgig/tubular/pull/309>`

1.3.0 (2024-06-13)
------------------
Added
^^^^^
- Inheritable tests for generic base behaviours for base transformer in `base_tests.py`, with fixtures to allow for this in `conftest.py`
- Split existing input check into two better defined checks for TwoColumnOperatorTransformer `#183 <https://github.com/lvgig/tubular/pull/183>`_
- Created unit tests for checking column type and size `#183 <https://github.com/lvgig/tubular/pull/183>`_
- Automated weights column checks through a mixin class and captured common weight tests in generic test classes for weighted transformers

Changed
^^^^^^^
- Standardised naming of weight arg across transformers 
- Update DataFrameMethodTransformer tests to have inheritable init class that can be used by othe test files.
- Moved BaseTransformer, DataFrameMethodTransformer, BaseMappingTransformer, BaseMappingTransformerMixin, CrossColumnMappingTransformer and Mapping Transformer over to the new testing framework.
- Refactored MappingTransformer by removing redundant init method.
- Refactored tests for ColumnDtypeSetter, and renamed (from SetColumnDtype)
- Refactored tests for SetValueTransformer
- Refactored ArbitraryImputer by removing redundant fillna call in transform method. This should increase tubular's efficiency and maintainability.
- Fixed bugs in MedianImputer and ModeImputer where they would error for all null columns.
- Refactored ArbitraryImputer and BaseImputer tests in new format.
- Refactored MedianImputer tests in new format.
- Replaced occurrences of pd.Dataframe.drop() with del statement to speed up tubular. Note that no additional unit testing has been done for copy=False as this release is scheduled to remove copy. 
- Created BaseCrossColumnNumericTransformer class. Refactored CrossColumnAddTransformer and CrossColumnMultiplyTransformer to use this class. Moved tests for these objects to new approach.
- Created BaseCrossColumnMappingTransformer class and integrated into CrossColumnMappingTransformer tests  
- Refactored BaseNominalTransformer tests in new format & moved its logic to the transform method.
- Refactored ModeImputer tests in new format.
- Added generic init tests to base tests for transformers that take two columns as an input.
- Refactored EqualityChecker tests in new format.
- Bugfix to MeanResponseTransformer to ignore unobserved categorical levels
- Refactored dates.py to prepare for testing refactor. Edited BaseDateTransformer (and created BaseDateTwoColumnTransformer) to follow standard format, implementing validations at init/fit/transform. To reduce complexity of file, made transformers more opinionated to insist on specific and consistent column dtypes.  `#246 <https://github.com/lvgig/tubular/pull/246>`_
- Added test_BaseTwoColumnTransformer base class for columns that require a list of two columns for input
- Added BaseDropOriginalMixin to mixin transformers to handle validation and method of dropping original features, also added appropriate test classes.
- Refactored MeanImputer tests in new format `#250 <https://github.com/lvgig/tubular/pull/250>`_
- Refactored DatetimeInfoExtractor to condense and improve readability
- added minimal_dataframe_lookup fixture to conftest, and edited generic tests to use this

- Refactored OHE transformer tests to align with new testing framework. 
- Moved fixtures relating only to a single test out of conftest and into testing script where utilised.
- !!!Introduced dependency on Sklearn's OneHotEncoder by adding test to check OHE transformer (which we are calling from within our OHE wrapper) is fit before transform 
- Refactored NearestMeanResponseImputer in line with new testing framework.


Removed
^^^^^^^
- Functionality for BaseTransformer (and thus all transformers) to take `None` as an option for columns. This behaviour was inconsistently implemented across transformers. Rather than extending to all we decided to remove this functionality. This required updating a lot of test files.
- The `columns_set_or_check()` method from BaseTransformer. With the above change it was no longer necessary. Subsequent updates to nominal transformers and their tests were required.
- Set pd copy_on_write to True (will become default in pandas 3.0) which allowed the functionality of the copy method of the transformers to be dropped `#197 <https://github.com/lvgig/tubular/pull/197>`_

------------------
Added
